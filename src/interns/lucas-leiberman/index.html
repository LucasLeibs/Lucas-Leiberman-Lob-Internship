        In the winter of 2020, I was studying graphic design at Western Washington University. I
        wasn’t sure if this was the path for me, which eventually
        led me to take a quarter off from school to reassess my passion. During this hiatus, I began exploring with code. After building my first website
        homepage with HTML & CSS, I was hooked. I was intrigued by the constant
        learning, adapting, and perseverance that coding required. I joined the Software Engineering Program at Flatiron five months later and I haven't looked back. I am extremely
        grateful for the experience, the knowledge, and the wonderful people I
        met along the way.
      </p>
      I am now ready to launch my career and I know Lob would be a great place
      to start. I hope to expand my toolbox, develop my skills, and contribute with a learning mindset
      and a positive attitude. I want hands-on experience in the industry and to
      soak up everything I possibly can. I love to create, design, and problem
      solve and hope to express these passions with this opportunity. My
      interests lie primarily in front end development. I am well-versed and
      educated in modern design principles and look to incorporate them into
      intuitive, interactive, and smooth UI’s. My goal as a developer is to
      create beautiful software and applications that connect people,
      increase productivity, and bring value to others in their everyday life.
