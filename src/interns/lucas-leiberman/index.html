      In the winter of 2020, I was studying graphic design at university. 
      I really wasn’t sure if that was the path I was meant for and eventually led to me to take a quarter away from school. 
      I began exploring with code...after building my first homepage with HTML & CSS, I was hooked. I joined a bootcamp five months later and I haven't looked back. 
      I am extremely grateful for the experience, the knowledge, and the wonderful people I met along the way. 
    </p>
    I am now ready to launch my career and I know Lob would be a great place to start. 
    I hope to grow, develop, and contribute with a learning mindset and a positive attitude. I want hands on experience in the industry and to soak up everything I possibly can. 
    I love to create, design, and problem solve and I hope I can express those passions during this opportunity.
    My interests lie primarily in frontend development. I am well versed and educated in modern design principles and look to incorporate them into intuitive, interactive, and smooth UI’s.
